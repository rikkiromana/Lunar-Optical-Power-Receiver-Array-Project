## Repository Contents

1. **Python Scripts:**  
   Contains Python scripts for simulation, analysis, and control of the LOPRA system.

2. **LTSpice Files:**  
   Includes LTSpice files for simulating the behavior of the photovoltaic array under various conditions.

## Using PyLTSpice and Python Libraries

We will use PyLTSpice for simulation and analysis of our LTSpice models. To use PyLTSpice, follow these steps:

1. **Install PyLTSpice:**  
   You can install PyLTSpice using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install PyLTSpice
   ```
   PyLTSpice GitHub: https://github.com/nunobrum/PyLTSpice

2. **Install Python Libraries:** 

   You will also need to make sure you have the following Python libraries for running the scripts:
   - `numpy`: For numerical computations
   - `scipy`: For scientific computations and integration
   - `matplotlib`: For data visualization
   You can install these libraries using pip:
    ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
   ```

## Getting Started
