# Lunar-Optical-Power-Receiver-Array-Project
Developing as a university capstone project in collaboration with the SUNLAB team, LOPRA is a lunar optical power receiving array designed to power shadowed lunar rovers. This repository contains Python and LTSpice codes for our photovoltaic array prototype, optimized to convert optical power transmissions into usable energy in space conditions.
